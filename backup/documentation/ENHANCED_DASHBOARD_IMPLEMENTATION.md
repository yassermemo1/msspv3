## Key Technical Implementations

### Chart Types and Visualizations

1. **Revenue Trend Chart** (ComposedChart)
   - Area chart for revenue
   - Bar chart for contracts
   - Line chart for new clients
   - Dual Y-axes for different metrics

2. **Industry Distribution** (PieChart)
   - Color-coded segments
   - Interactive labels
   - Click-through to client details

3. **Contract Status** (BarChart)
   - Color-coded status bars
   - Click-through navigation

4. **Service Utilization** (BarChart)
   - Utilization vs capacity comparison
   - Multiple data series

5. **Team Performance** (BarChart)
   - Completed vs pending tasks
   - Member-wise breakdown

6. **Client Satisfaction** (LineChart)
   - Trend over time
   - Score range validation

### Filter System Implementation

```typescript
interface FilterOption {
  key: string;
  label: string;
  type: 'text' | 'select' | 'date' | 'dateRange' | 'checkbox' | 'multiselect' | 'number';
  options?: { value: string; label: string }[];
  placeholder?: string;
  icon?: React.ComponentType<{ className?: string }>;
}
```

### Drill-Down Functionality

- Revenue breakdown by client and contract
- Industry analysis with client metrics
- Contract details with status filtering
- Service utilization with revenue metrics
- Team performance with task completion
- Client satisfaction with feedback details

## Database Queries and Performance

### Enhanced Statistics Query
- Time-based filtering with parameterized queries
- JOIN operations for related data
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
- GROUP BY for categorical data
- LIMIT for performance optimization

### Sample Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
  COALESCE(c.industry, 'Other') as name,
  COUNT(*) as value
FROM clients c 
WHERE c.created_at >= $1
GROUP BY c.industry 
ORDER BY value DESC
```

## Security and Validation

### File Upload Security
- MIME type validation
- File size limits (2MB)
- Unique filename generation
- Path traversal protection
- Old file cleanup

### API Security
- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Error handling and logging

## UI/UX Enhancements
