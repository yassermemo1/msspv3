## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Page-Level Security**
- ✅ Dynamic navigation based on role
- ✅ PageGuard component blocks unauthorized access
- ✅ Server-side permission checking
- ✅ Database-driven permissions

### 2. **API-Level Security**
- ✅ `requireAuth` - Basic authentication check
- ✅ `requireAdmin` - Admin-only endpoints
- ✅ `requireManagerOrAbove` - Manager/Admin endpoints
- ✅ `requireEngineerOrAbove` - Engineer/Manager/Admin endpoints

### 3. **Middleware Protection**
```typescript
// Example usage in routes:
app.post("/api/clients", requireManagerOrAbove, handler);
app.get("/api/audit-logs", requireAdmin, handler);
app.put("/api/hardware-assets/:id", requireEngineerOrAbove, handler);
```

### 4. **Database Schema**
- `page_permissions` table with role columns
- `role_permissions` table for granular permissions
- `users` table with role field
- Audit logging for all permission changes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Components**
1. **PageGuard** - Wraps protected routes
2. **DynamicNavigation** - Shows only accessible pages
3. **RbacPage** - Admin UI for managing permissions
4. **UnauthorizedPage** - User-friendly access denied page

### **Backend Endpoints**
1. `/api/user/accessible-pages` - Returns pages for current user
2. `/api/page-permissions` - Admin endpoint for managing permissions
3. `/api/users` - User management (admin only)
4. Role-specific middleware on all protected endpoints

### **Database Tables**
1. **page_permissions**
   - Stores page access rules per role
   - 27 pages configured
   - Dynamic enable/disable

2. **role_permissions**
   - Granular resource/action permissions
   - 48 permission rules defined
   - Extensible for future features

3. **users**
   - Role field determines access level
   - 4 test users created
   - Support for LDAP integration
