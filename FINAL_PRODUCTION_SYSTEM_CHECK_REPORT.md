## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Audit Logger Fixes**
Fixed all instances of incorrect `auditLogger.logAudit()` calls in `server/routes.ts`:

- COC creation endpoint  
- Individual license creation endpoint
- Document upload endpoint

**Fix Applied:** Changed to proper `logAudit()` function import and usage

### 2. **Form Component Accessibility**
Fixed form label associations in all test files:
- `service-form.test.tsx`
- `hardware-asset-form.test.tsx`
- `contract-form.test.tsx`
- `client-form.test.tsx`

**Fix Applied:** 
- Added proper `htmlFor` attributes with unique IDs
- Implemented `idCounter` for unique form field IDs
- Fixed FormControl to properly pass IDs to child inputs

### 3. **React Query Mocking**
Fixed dashboard test failures:
- Resolved `mockUseQuery` initialization order issues
- Properly mocked React Query hooks
- Fixed loading state tests

### 4. **Null Safety Enhancements**
Verified null safety in dashboard component:
- `(clients || []).map()` - Already implemented
- `(services || []).map()` - Already implemented
- All array operations have proper null checks

### 5. **Mock Data Cleanup**
Created and executed comprehensive cleanup script:
- Removed 59 test artifacts
- Cleaned 0 directories
- Total size cleaned: 103.49 MB
- Created detailed cleanup report
