# Clean Database Setup Summary

## What Was Done

1. **Fixed Schema Issues**
   - Removed duplicate field definitions in the `services` table
   - Standardized all column names to use snake_case (e.g., `delivery_model`, `base_price`)
   - Added missing `schema_versions` table to the schema

2. **Created Fresh Database**
   - Dropped the old `mssp_database`
   - Created a new clean `mssp_database`
   - Applied the corrected schema using Drizzle

3. **Populated Initial Data**
   - Admin user: `admin@mssp.local` with password `SecureTestPass123!`
   - 4 sample services (SOC, Vulnerability Management, etc.)
   - 3 sample clients (Acme, Global Finance, Healthcare Solutions)
   - Company settings initialized

4. **Set Up Page Permissions**
   - Created 12 page permission entries
   - Admin has access to all pages:
     - Dashboard
     - Clients
     - Contracts
     - Services
     - Licenses
     - Hardware
     - Reports
     - Admin
     - External Systems
     - SAF
     - COC
     - Audit Logs
   - User settings created for the admin user

## Current Database State
- **Database**: `mssp_database` (clean, no duplicates)

- **Column Names**: Consistent snake_case throughout
- **Data**: Initial data loaded successfully

## Application Status
- Server is running on port 5001
- Database connection is working
- Admin user can log in with full permissions
- All navigation menu items should now be visible

## Key Fixes Applied
1. ✅ No duplicate column definitions
2. ✅ Consistent snake_case naming convention
3. ✅ All required tables present (including `schema_versions`)
4. ✅ Page permissions properly configured
5. ✅ User settings initialized

## Login Credentials
