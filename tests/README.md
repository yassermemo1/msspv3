## Test Data Management

### Test Database
- Separate test database for integration tests
- Test data seeding and cleanup
- Factory functions for creating test data

### Mock Data
- Realistic test data that mirrors production
- Consistent data across all test types
- Automated data generation for performance tests

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
- Automated test execution on pull requests
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback
- Test result reporting and coverage tracking
- Visual regression detection

### Quality Gates
- Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Performance benchmarks for load tests
- Visual diff approval process

## Best Practices

### Unit Tests
- Test component behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and error scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Test real API endpoints with test database
- Verify data persistence and retrieval
- Test authentication and authorization
- Include error handling and edge cases

### E2E Tests
- Test complete user workflows
- Use page object model for maintainability
- Include accessibility testing
- Test across different browsers and devices

### Performance
- Set performance budgets and monitor
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption
- Test concurrent user scenarios

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update test data to reflect application changes
- Review and update test coverage targets
- Maintain test environment consistency
