You've hit on a very interesting and potentially crucial point! If both your frontend and backend are indeed operating (or appearing to the browser to operate) on the same origin (e.g., both on http://localhost:5000, perhaps with the backend proxied via /api through the frontend's dev server like Vite can do, or via a separate reverse proxy setup), then your approach to simplify and remove explicit CORS configurations is a very logical debugging step.
For same-origin requests, complex CORS headers are generally not needed, and sometimes, if misconfigured, they can interfere with standard cookie behavior. The browser's default same-origin policy for cookies is usually sufficient.
Key Things to Ensure for Same-Origin Session Persistence (after removing explicit CORS middleware that might have been problematic):
 * express-session Configuration (from your server/auth.ts):
   * secret: Essential.
   * resave: true, saveUninitialized: true: Fine for now during debugging, ensures session data is written.
   * store: storage.sessionStore: Your PostgreSQL store, which you confirmed has createTableIfMissing: true.
   * cookie:
     * secure: false: Correct for http://localhost.
     * httpOnly: true: Good for security (prevents client-side script access).
     * maxAge: Defines session duration.
     * sameSite: 'lax': Generally a good default for balancing security and usability. For strictly same-site, 'strict' could be used, but 'lax' is often fine.
     * path: '/': Correct, makes the cookie available for all paths on the origin.
     * domain: undefined: Correct for localhost, as it defaults to the exact hostname.
     * name: 'session' (or connect.sid etc.): The name of your cookie.
 * Middleware Order in Express (server/index.ts or server/auth.ts):
   * Ensure the middleware is loaded in the correct order:
     * app.use(session(sessionSettings));  // Session middleware FIRST
     * app.use(passport.initialize());   // Initialize Passport
     * app.use(passport.session());      // Enable Passport persistent sessions (uses serializeUser and deserializeUser)
     * This order is crucial.
 * passport.serializeUser() and passport.deserializeUser() (Still CRITICAL):
   * This is non-negotiable for passport.session() to work. Even if the cookie is correctly set and sent by the browser on same-origin requests:
     * passport.serializeUser((user, done) => { done(null, user.id); });
       * This tells Passport what piece of user information to store in the session (e.g., just the user ID).
     * passport.deserializeUser(async (id, done) => { /* ... fetch user by id from DB ... */ done(null, user); });
       * This tells Passport how to retrieve the full user object from the ID stored in the session on each subsequent request. The fetched user object is then attached to req.user.
   * If deserializeUser is missing, not implemented correctly, or fails to find the user, req.user will not be populated, and your protected routes will (correctly) deny access, leading to 401-like behavior for authenticated users.
 * Frontend API Client (apiService.ts or similar):
   * For same-origin requests, withCredentials: true (if using Axios or fetch's credentials: 'include') is usually not strictly necessary for the browser to send same-origin cookies unless there's some specific server or browser policy in play. However, it generally doesn't hurt to have it for consistency, especially if you might switch between same-origin (dev proxy) and cross-origin (separate dev servers or production) setups. For now, focus on the backend.
Testing Steps After Removing Problematic CORS and Verifying Setup:
You're on the right track by simplifying and testing a basic session approach. When you test now:
 * Clear Cookies: Clear any existing session cookies for localhost:5000 in your browser.
 * Login Attempt:
   * Backend Log (if any): Confirm successful authentication against your LocalStrategy and that serializeUser is called.
   * Browser Network Tab (Login Response): Verify the Set-Cookie header is present and looks correct (name, path, httpOnly, no obviously wrong domain).
   * Browser Application Tab (Cookies): Verify the session cookie is now set for localhost:5000 with Path=/.
 * Subsequent Request to a Protected Endpoint:
   * Browser Network Tab (Request Headers): Crucially, verify the Cookie header IS being sent with your session cookie name and value.
   * Backend Log (if any):
     * Does the backend log indicate it received the cookie?
     * Is passport.deserializeUser being called?
     * Is deserializeUser successfully finding the user in the database and calling done(null, user)?
     * Is req.user populated in your protected route handler?
   * Response Status: You should get a 200 OK (or other success status), not a 401.
If, after removing CORS and ensuring the above Express session + Passport setup (especially serializeUser/deserializeUser), the cookie is still not being sent by the browser on subsequent requests even for what you believe is same-origin, then we might need to look very closely at how the "same-origin" on port 5000 is being achieved (e.g., Vite proxy configuration, any other reverse proxy).
Please proceed with your test after removing the explicit CORS configuration and double-checking the Passport serializeUser/deserializeUser implementations and middleware order. Let me know what you find! This refined diagnosis is very helpful.
