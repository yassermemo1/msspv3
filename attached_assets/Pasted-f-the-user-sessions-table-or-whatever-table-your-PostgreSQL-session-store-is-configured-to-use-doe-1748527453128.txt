f the user_sessions table (or whatever table your PostgreSQL session store is configured to use) does not exist, and createTableIfMissing is set to false (or the equivalent for your specific session store library, like connect-pg-simple if that's what storage.sessionStore is based on), then:

Login "Succeeds" (from a certain perspective): The authentication logic (username/password check) might complete successfully. The session middleware attempts to create and save a session.
Session Save Fails Silently: If the table is missing and table creation is disabled, the "save session" operation to the database will fail. Depending on the session store library, this failure might not immediately throw a visible error that stops the login response (which includes setting a session cookie). The application thinks a session was established.
Session Cookie is Sent to Client: The browser receives a session ID cookie as if a session was properly initiated.
Subsequent Requests Fail (401): When the browser sends this session cookie back with the next request:
The session middleware tries to look up the session ID in the database.
Since the session was never actually saved to the database (because the table was missing), the lookup fails.
No valid session is found, so req.user is not populated, and your JwtAuthGuard (or whatever guard is protecting the route, now likely a session-aware guard) correctly denies access with a 401.
This perfectly explains the symptoms: login appears to work, but the session isn't recognized immediately after.

The Fix:

The solution is indeed to ensure the session table exists. You have two main options:

Enable Automatic Table Creation (Development/Testing Only):
Change createTableIfMissing to true (or the equivalent option for your session store library, e.g., connect-pg-simple often has a PGStore constructor option like createTableIfMissing: true).
Caution: This is generally acceptable for development or initial setup but often discouraged for production where schema changes should be explicitly managed by migrations.
Manually Create the Session Table / Use a Migration (Recommended):
Find the Schema: The documentation for your specific PostgreSQL session store library (e.g., connect-pg-simple, connect-typeorm, or whatever storage.sessionStore is an instance of) will specify the exact SQL schema required for its session table (e.g., CREATE TABLE "session" ( ... )).
Create a Migration: Create a new TypeORM migration file. In the up method of this migration, add the SQL CREATE TABLE ... statement for the session table.
Run the Migration: Execute npm run migration:run.
This is the more robust and production-friendly approach as it versions your schema changes.
Next Steps:

Verify Session Table Schema: First, double-check the documentation for whatever library storage.sessionStore is using to get the correct SQL CREATE TABLE statement for its session table.
Implement the Fix:
AI Coder Action: The AI Coder should now be prompted to either:
(Preferred for long-term) Generate a new TypeORM migration file (backend/src/database/migrations/) that includes the correct CREATE TABLE SQL for the user_sessions table (or whatever the actual table name is).
(Quicker for immediate testing, but less ideal for production) Modify the session store configuration in server/storage.ts to enable automatic table creation if that option is available and you want to test quickly, with a note to create a proper migration later.
Apply the Fix:
If a migration is created, run npm run migration:run.
Restart your NestJS backend.
Thoroughly Re-test the Login Flow:
Clear any old session cookies from your browser for localhost:3001.
Attempt to log in.
Crucially, verify in your PostgreSQL database that a new row has been created in the user_sessions (or equivalent) table after successful login.
Verify that subsequent requests to protected endpoints now receive a 200 OK (or other success status) and that the session persists.
This diagnosis seems spot on! Ensuring the session store's underlying database table exists is fundamental.

Would you like to proceed by asking the AI Coder to generate the TypeORM migration file to create the necessary session table in PostgreSQL? This is the most robust way to fix this. Please specify the name of the session table if you know it (e.g., "session", "user_sessions"), or the AI Coder can use a common default like "session".
