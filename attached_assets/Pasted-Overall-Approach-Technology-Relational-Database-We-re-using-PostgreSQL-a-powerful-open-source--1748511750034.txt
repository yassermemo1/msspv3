Overall Approach & Technology:

Relational Database: We're using PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database.
Object-Relational Mapper (ORM): The NestJS backend interacts with PostgreSQL via TypeORM, which allows us to define our database schema using TypeScript classes (entities) and decorators.
Migration-Based Schema Management: All schema changes (creating tables, adding columns, defining relationships, creating indexes) are managed through version-controlled migration scripts generated and run by TypeORM. This ensures a consistent schema across different environments and avoids data loss (synchronize: false is a key setting).
Design Principles: The design prioritizes data integrity, scalability, query performance, security, and flexibility to accommodate the diverse needs of an MSSP.
Key Entity Groups and Their Purpose:

The database is structured around several core concepts, each represented by one or more entities (tables):

Core Foundational Entities (Phase 1):

User: Stores information about your internal MSSP team members.
Key Fields: id (UUID), firstName, lastName, email (unique, indexed), password (hashed), role (enum like ADMIN, MANAGER, ENGINEER), isActive, failedLoginAttempts, isLocked, lastPasswordChangeAt, lastLoginAt, authProvider (e.g., 'local', for future LDAP).
Purpose: User authentication, authorization (RBAC), and internal team member identification.
Client: Represents your MSSP's customers.
Key Fields: id (UUID), companyName (unique, indexed), contactName, contactEmail, contactPhone, address, industry, status (enum like PROSPECT, ACTIVE, ARCHIVED), clientSource (enum), notes, business intelligence fields (leadScore, estimatedDealValue, companySize enum), firstInteractionDate, and a customClientSpecificJsonData (JSONB) for initial ad-hoc details.
Purpose: Central repository for all client information and lifecycle tracking.
Service & Contract Management Entities (Phase 2):

Service: Defines your MSSP's service catalog.
Key Fields: id (UUID), name (unique), description, category (enum), deliveryModel (enum), basePrice (decimal), isActive, and crucially, scopeDefinitionTemplate (JSONB) to define dynamic parameters for each service.
Purpose: Master list of services offered, with templates for how their scopes are defined.
Contract: Manages agreements with clients.
Key Fields: id (UUID), contractName, startDate, endDate (for expiration tracking), renewalDate, value (decimal), status (enum like DRAFT, ACTIVE, EXPIRED), documentLink, previousContractId (self-referencing for renewals).
Relationships: Many-to-One with Client. One-to-Many with ServiceScope.
Purpose: Tracking contractual obligations, terms, and lifecycle with clients.
ServiceScope (or ContractService): Links specific services to a contract with unique scope details.
Key Fields: id (UUID), scopeDetails (JSONB, populated based on Service.scopeDefinitionTemplate), price (for this instance), quantity, unit. Also includes SAF (Service Activation Form) details: safDocumentLink, safServiceStartDate, safServiceEndDate, safStatus (enum).
Relationships: Many-to-One with Contract, Many-to-One with Service. One-to-Many with Proposal.
Purpose: Details exactly what version/configuration of a service a client gets under a contract, including its activation status.
Proposal: Manages sales and technical proposals.
Key Fields: id (UUID), proposalType (enum: TECHNICAL, FINANCIAL), documentLink, version, status (enum), proposedValue (decimal), currency, validUntilDate, assigneeUserId (FK to User).
Relationships: Many-to-One with ServiceScope.
Purpose: Tracking proposals related to specific services being offered within a contract negotiation.
License & Asset Management Entities (Phase 3):

LicensePool: Your MSSP's inventory of software licenses.
Key Fields: id (UUID), productName, vendor, licenseType (enum), totalSeats, expiryDate, costPerSeat.
ClientLicense: Licenses assigned from a pool to a client.
Key Fields: id (UUID), assignedSeats, assignmentDate, status.
Relationships: Many-to-One with LicensePool, Many-to-One with Client.
HardwareAsset: Your MSSP's hardware inventory.
Key Fields: id (UUID), assetTag (unique), serialNumber (unique), deviceName, manufacturer, model, assetType (enum), status (enum: IN_STOCK, IN_USE, RETIRED).
ClientHardwareAssignment: Tracks hardware assigned to clients.
Key Fields: id (UUID), assignmentDate, returnDate, status.
Relationships: Many-to-One with HardwareAsset, Many-to-One with Client, optional Many-to-One with ServiceScope (to link hardware to a specific contracted service).
Financials & Team Entities (Phase 4):

FinancialTransaction: Records costs and revenues.
Key Fields: id (UUID), type (enum: REVENUE_ vs COST_), amount (decimal), currency, transactionDate, description, status (enum).
Relationships: Optional Many-to-One links to Client, Contract, ServiceScope, LicensePool, HardwareAsset, and a User (recordedByUserId).
ClientTeamAssignment: Links internal team members (Users) to Clients.
Key Fields: id (UUID), assignmentRole (enum: ACCOUNT_MANAGER, LEAD_ENGINEER).
Relationships: Many-to-One with User, Many-to-One with Client. Unique constraint on user+client+role to prevent duplicate roles.
Dashboard & Integration Support Entities (Phase 5):

SLAMetric: Tracks SLA performance (target vs. actual, breach status), linked to relevant entities.
TicketSummary: Stores summarized ticket information (for Jira sync or manual entry), linked to clients.
ServicePerformanceMetric: For time-series data for service-specific metrics (EDR, SIEM, NDR gauges).
ClientSubscriptionSnapshot: Periodic snapshots for trend analysis (client counts, revenue).
ExternalDataSource: Configuration for connecting to external REST APIs (Jira, Grafana), including URL, auth type, and encrypted credentials.
DataSourceQuery: Specific query definitions for an ExternalDataSource, including endpoint, JQL/query template, and JSONPath for data extraction.
Custom Fields Entity (Phase 6):

CustomFieldDefinition: Stores metadata for admin-defined custom fields (entityType, name, label, fieldType, selectOptions, etc.).
Value Storage: A customFieldData: JSONB column is added to all major operational entities (Client, Contract, Proposal, Service, ServiceScope, User, etc.) to store the values of these custom fields.
Key Database Design Principles Applied:

Normalization: Entities are generally normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity, with relationships defined via foreign keys.
UUIDs for Primary Keys: Ensures global uniqueness and avoids issues with sequential ID exposure or distributed systems.
Enums for Controlled Vocabularies: Used extensively for statuses, types, categories, etc., to maintain data consistency and allow for clear, predefined options.
JSONB for Flexibility: Strategically used for Service.scopeDefinitionTemplate, ServiceScope.scopeDetails, and Client.customClientSpecificJsonData (and customFieldData on other entities) to allow for dynamic, user-defined parameters and attributes without altering the core table structure frequently.
Timestamps: createdAt and updatedAt on most entities for auditing.
Indexing: Strategic use of indexes on foreign keys, unique constraints, and frequently queried/filtered fields (like statuses, dates, names, email) to optimize query performance.
Relationship Management: Clear use of TypeORM decorators (@ManyToOne, @OneToMany, @JoinColumn, etc.) to define relationships, with consideration for ON DELETE behaviors (like CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET NULL) to maintain referential integrity.
Soft Deletes & Status Lifecycles: Preference for using isActive flags or comprehensive status enums (e.g., ClientStatus, ContractStatus) to manage the lifecycle of records rather than hard deletes, preserving historical data where appropriate.
This database design aims to provide a robust, scalable, and flexible foundation that can support all the complex features and workflows of your MSSP Client Management Platform.
