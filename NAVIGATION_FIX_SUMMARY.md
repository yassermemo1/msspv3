# Navigation Visibility Fix Summary

## Problem
Admin user could not see all navigation links despite having page permissions set correctly in the database.

## Root Cause
The `/api/user/accessible-pages` endpoint had a mismatch between the code and database column names:
- Code was using camelCase: `adminAccess`, `managerAccess`
- Database uses snake_case: `admin_access`, `manager_access`

## Solution Applied
Fixed the endpoint to properly map user roles to the correct column names in the page_permissions table.

## Results
✅ Admin user can now see all 12 navigation items:
1. Dashboard
2. Clients
3. Contracts
4. Services
5. Licenses
6. Hardware
7. Reports
8. Admin
9. External Systems
10. SAF (Service Authorization Forms)
11. COC (Certificates of Compliance)
12. Audit Logs

## Technical Details
- The DynamicNavigation component fetches from `/api/user/accessible-pages`
- This endpoint checks the user's role and queries the page_permissions table
- All 12 pages have `admin_access = true` in the database
- The fix ensures the correct column is referenced based on the user's role

## Status
✅ Navigation is now fully functional for admin users
✅ All pages are accessible through the sidebar menu
✅ Role-based access control is working correctly
