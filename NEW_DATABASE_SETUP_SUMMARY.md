# New Database Setup Summary

## Overview
A new database has been created for the MSSP Client Manager application, completely independent from the existing `mssp_production` database.

## Database Details
- **Database Name**: `mssp_database`
- **User**: `mssp_user`
- **Password**: `12345678`
- **Host**: `localhost`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Connection String**: `postgresql://mssp_user:12345678@localhost:5432/mssp_database`

## What Was Done
1. **Created new database**: A fresh PostgreSQL database called `mssp_database` was created
2. **Applied schema**: The application's schema was pushed to the new database using Drizzle ORM
3. **Added initial data**:
   - Admin user: `admin@mssp.local` (password: `SecureTestPass123!`)
   - 4 sample services (Security Operations Center, Vulnerability Management, etc.)
   - 3 sample clients (Acme Corporation, Global Finance Inc, HealthCare Solutions)
   - Company settings initialized

## Application Status
- The application is now running at: http://localhost:5001
- The frontend is available at: http://localhost:5173
- You can log in with: 
  - Email: `admin@mssp.local`
  - Password: `SecureTestPass123!`

## Key Changes
- The application now uses a completely separate database (`mssp_database`) instead of `mssp_production`
- All environment variables have been updated to point to the new database
- The schema matches what the application expects

## Files Created/Modified
1. `create-new-database.sh` - Script to create the new database
2. `create-initial-data.cjs` - Script to populate initial data
3. `.env` - Updated with new database connection details

## Next Steps
The application is ready to use with the new database. All API endpoints should now work correctly as the schema matches the application's expectations.
