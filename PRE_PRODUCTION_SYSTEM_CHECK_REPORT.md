## üîß Technical Fixes Implemented

### Dashboard Component Improvements
```typescript
// Fixed null safety issues
(clients || []).map(c => ({ value: c.id.toString(), label: c.name }))
(services || []).map(s => s.category)
```

### Test Infrastructure Enhancements
1. **React Query Mocking:** Implemented proper `useQuery` mocking
2. **Component Mocking:** Fixed Recharts component exports
3. **Form Accessibility:** Enhanced form label associations
4. **ID Counter Management:** Resolved scope issues in test mocks

### Files Modified
- `client/src/components/dashboard/enhanced-dashboard.tsx` - Added null safety
- `tests/unit/components/dashboard.test.tsx` - Enhanced React Query mocking
- `tests/unit/components/service-form.test.tsx` - Fixed form mocking and accessibility
- `scripts/cleanup-mock-data.js` - Created comprehensive cleanup script

## üìä Test Results Analysis

### Unit Tests Progress
| Category | Initial | Final | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Total Tests** | 112 | 111 | -1 |
| **Failed Tests** | 69 | 55 | -14 (20% reduction) |
| **Passed Tests** | 28 | 41 | +13 (46% increase) |
| **Skipped Tests** | 15 | 15 | 0 |

### Key Issues Resolved
1. **Dashboard Data Loading:** Fixed React Query mocking for proper data flow
2. **Form Component Testing:** Enhanced accessibility and validation testing
3. **Chart Component Mocking:** Resolved missing Recharts component exports
4. **ID Counter Scope:** Fixed test utility variable scoping issues

### Remaining Issues (For Future Iteration)
1. **Form Validation Mocking:** Some validation tests still need refinement
2. **Select Component Accessibility:** Multiple select elements causing conflicts
3. **React Hook Form Integration:** Mock implementation needs enhancement
