## ⚠️ **Important Notes for Operations**

### Breaking Changes
- **Dashboard Settings**: Users' previous localStorage dashboard settings will be replaced with database defaults
- **First Login**: Users will see default dashboard cards and can immediately customize them
- **API Changes**: New dashboard endpoints added (existing endpoints unchanged)

### Performance Impact
- **Database**: Minimal impact - new table with lightweight records
- **Frontend**: Bundle size increased by ~200KB for drag-drop functionality
- **Memory**: Negligible impact on server memory usage

### Monitoring Points
- **Database Connections**: Monitor for any connection pool issues
- **API Response Times**: Check dashboard endpoint performance
- **User Adoption**: Track usage of new customization features

## 🐛 **Known Issues (Non-Blocking)**

1. **TypeScript Warnings**: Some existing form components have type warnings (not affecting functionality)
2. **Test Updates**: Unit tests may need minor updates for new components (planned for post-release)
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Tested on modern browsers; older IE versions not supported

## 🔄 **Rollback Plan**

If issues arise, rollback steps:
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
git checkout v1.4.3

# Reinstall previous dependencies  
npm install

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart server
npm run start
```

**Note**: Database rollback not needed as new table doesn't affect existing functionality.
